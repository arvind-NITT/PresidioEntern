Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


The __init__() Function

The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

The pass Statement
class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.


Python Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Python Modules
What is a Module?
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
